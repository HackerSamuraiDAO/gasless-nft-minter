# gasless-nft-minter


## Why we build ?
One major problem with Web3 is the high entry hurdle for ordinary users. In particular, the process for users to create their own NFTs is too difficult.
Making Web3 wallet is not difficult but getting native tokens like ETH or MATIC is really difficult. They have to do some steps like create CEX account and transfer token etc...

We would like to break these hurdle and make creating own NFT more easy for everyone from kid to elder to use like posting SNS.
That's why we build this application.


## What is this ?
In this dapp, users can deploy and mint their NFTs and sell it at Opensea without gas. We pay the gas fee on behalf of our users so they don't need to get native gas token. Instead, when their assets are sold, we get a commission from the value of the transaction.
